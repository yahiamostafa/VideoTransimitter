# VideoTransimitter
Simulation of how packets are transimitted in a noisy channel and we try to restore the transimitted message using convolutional code .

1- Sending the packets with ``no channel coding `` and plotting ````BER````.
2- sending the packet by encoding it using ``convolutional code with constant rate 1/2`` and decode it and plotting ````BER````.
3-sending the packet by encoding it using ``convolutional code with incremental rate 1/2`` and decode it and plotting the ````throughput```` and ````BER````.
